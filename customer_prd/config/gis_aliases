# Smallworld Core Windows Platforms Standard Core Product Aliases
#
# The Smallworld Product's standard aliases file should not be edited
# by hand.  A user can have personal aliases by placing them in a file
# named `gis_aliases' in his/her home directory, but the alias names
# must be chosen not to clash with those in the standard aliases file.
